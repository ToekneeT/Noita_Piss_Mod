# Noita Piss Mod
Just a small mod for the game Noita. Changes it so that when the player gets damaged, they leak urine instead of blood.
Getting a perk that changes the blood of the character should overwrite it with the new blood stain.
Can be used for a small "challenge" since the urine stain effect makes it so the player is more likely to take a critical hit.

## Why?
**Why not?**
Thought it'd be funny, and was a simple mod to make for the first step towards making mods.

## Installation
The mod can be found on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3220639038).

However, if you want to install it manually:

Go to Noita's game directory and place the downloaded files in the mods folder.
The mods folder on Steam is found here:
`Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods\`

Once in game, enable it through the mods menu.
